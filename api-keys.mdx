For integrating Layerswap, partners should register in the Dashboard and set up an organization.

Each partner account can create an organization and app(s) within that organization. The organization serves as a logical grouping for multiple associated apps. The app stores all the partner-related information like API keys for programmatic access, webhooks, and other configurations that are needed for the integration and customizations.

### Register as a Partner

1. Go to https://layerswap.io/dashboard and register
2. Create an organization & app under the organization
3. Go to the newly created app and copy the API key

### Enviorments

Dashboard will give you two types of API keys: Mainnet and Testnet. Respectively, if you use the Mainnet API key, you will get only mainnet networks, and the same applies to testnets.

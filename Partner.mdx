For integrating Layerswap, partners should register in the [Dashboard](https://layerswap.io/dashboard) and set up an organization.

Each partner account can create an organization and app(s) within that organization. The organization serves as a logical grouping for multiple associated apps. The app stores all the partner-related information like API keys for programmatic access, webhooks, and other configurations that are needed for the integration and customizations.

### Register as a Partner

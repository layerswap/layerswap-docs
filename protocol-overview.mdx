Layerswap enables seamless crypto transfers across different networks and exchanges through a robust protocol that handles millions of dollars in daily transactions. Here's how it works from end to end:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    Partners must first:
    1. Register at layerswap.io/dashboard
    2. Create an organization and app
    3. Obtain API keys for either mainnet or testnet environments
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transfer Initiation">
    Transfers can be initiated in two ways:

      <Card title="API Integration" icon="server">
        Create programmatic swaps using the API:
        ```bash
        curl --location 'https://api.layerswap.io/api/swap' \
        --header 'X-LS-APIKEY: {YOUR_APP_APIKEY}' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "source": "ETHEREUM_MAINNET",
            "destination": "IMX_MAINNET",
            "amount": 0.001,
            "asset": "ETH",
            "source_address": "0x...",
            "destination_address": "0x...",
            "refuel": false
        }'
        ```
      </Card>
      <Card title="UI Integration" icon="browser">
        Embed Layerswap directly or redirect to hosted page:
        ```javascript
        <iframe src="https://layerswap.io/app/?
            clientId=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
            &to=STARKNET_MAINNET
            &from=ETHEREUM_MAINNET
            &destAddress=0x...">
        </iframe>
        ```
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transfer Methods">
    Layerswap supports two transfer methods:

    <Accordion title="Wallet Transfers">
      Direct wallet connections where the dApp composes and sends transactions for signing and execution. Used when wallet connection is available.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Manual Transfers">
      Layerswap generates a unique deposit address for each swap. Any transaction sent to this address completes the swap - ideal when direct wallet connection isn't possible.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Swap Lifecycle">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/swap-life.png" />
    </Frame>

    1. **User Transfer Pending**: Initial state after swap creation
    2. **LS Transfer Pending**: After user transaction is received and matched
    3. **Completed**: After successful destination network transaction
    4. **Failed**: If destination transaction cannot be processed
    5. **Cancelled/Expired**: If user cancels or 4-day window expires
  </Step>

  <Step title="Status Tracking">
    Partners can track swap status through:
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="API Polling" icon="rotate">
        Query swap status endpoints periodically
      </Card>
      <Card title="Webhooks" icon="webhook">
        Receive real-time notifications for status changes
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
For production deployments, always use mainnet API keys. Testnet keys should only be used for development and testing purposes.
</Note>

<Warning>
API keys should be stored securely and never exposed in client-side code. Always make API calls from your backend services.

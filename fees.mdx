### Fee breakdown

Layerswap fees are designed to be transparent and predictable. Every quote includes a detailed cost breakdown so you know exactly what you're paying for. The total cost of a transfer is made up of three components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Layerswap fees** | A percentage-based service fee defined per route (e.g. 0.05%). This is Layerswap's commission for facilitating the transfer. |
| **Bridge expenses** | Covers gas and network costs on the source and destination chains. This is typically a fixed USD amount, periodically updated to reflect current network conditions. On multi-provider routes, an external bridge may add a percentage-based component. |
| **Market impact** | The price difference caused by on-chain swaps when the route involves a DEX. For same-token transfers (e.g. USDC → USDC) this is typically $0. |

<Note>
  The price impact breakdown is visible in the app by hovering over the fee indicator before confirming a transfer.

### How fees are calculated

**Layerswap fees** are calculated as a percentage of the transfer amount. The percentage varies by route — each source/destination pair has its own rate. Some routes may also include a small fixed USD component on top of the percentage.

**Bridge expenses** are derived from the actual gas costs observed on recent transactions for that route. They cover:
- The output transaction fee on the destination network
- Sweeping fees (when deposit addresses are used)
- Refuel fees (if native gas is sent to the destination address)

**Market impact** only applies when the route involves an on-chain swap (e.g. bridging ETH on Arbitrum to USDC on Base). For direct token routes the market impact is $0.

### Multi-provider routes

Layerswap can chain its own liquidity with external bridges — CCTP, LayerZero, Axelar, CCIP, or native rollup bridges — to serve routes that aren't covered by direct liquidity alone.

On these **multi-provider routes**, the bridge expenses may include costs from the external bridge, and the transfer time depends on the underlying protocol. For example, a route that uses CCTP + Layerswap may take around 20 minutes, while a direct Layerswap route typically completes in seconds.

The availability of fast, direct routes depends on where liquidity is positioned at any given moment.

### Fetching fees via the API

To get the fee breakdown for a **specific amount**, use the [`/v2/quote`](/api-reference/swaps/get-quote) endpoint:

```bash
curl "https://api.layerswap.io/api/v2/quote?\
source_network=ETHEREUM_MAINNET&\
source_token=USDC&\
destination_network=ARBITRUM_MAINNET&\
destination_token=USDC&\
amount=1000"
```

The response includes:

```jsonc
{
  "quote": {
    // blockchain_fee + service_fee
    "total_fee": 0.55,
    // total fee in USD
    "total_fee_in_usd": 0.55,
    // gas & network costs (bridge expenses)
    "blockchain_fee": 0.05,
    // Layerswap's commission
    "service_fee": 0.50,
    // estimated amount at destination
    "receive_amount": 999.45,
    // minimum after slippage tolerance
    "min_receive_amount": 994.46,
    ...
  }
}
```

To see fees **across all possible amounts** for a route, use the [`/v2/detailed_quote`](/api-reference/swaps/get-detailed-quote) endpoint instead — it returns the total percentage fee and fixed fee components, along with calculated fees at the minimum and maximum transfer amounts.

### Fee discounts

Layerswap runs fee discount campaigns with select partners. When a campaign is active for a route, the discount is automatically applied to the quote and reflected in the `fee_discount` field in the API response.

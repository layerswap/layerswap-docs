Layerswap is a prebuilt, optimized gateway that lets anyone easily and securely process transactions across multiple networks – overcoming liquidity fragmentation and complex bridging steps. Layerswap’s built-in features allow you to reduce your development time. 

You can utilize Layerswap's transacting infrastructure in four main ways:

## React Widget

Layerswap provides native React component, which allows rendering Layerswap widget directly inside your app.

## Layerswap-hosted page

You can redirect users from your Web or Mobile app to Layerswap and customize their journey by providing [query parameters](/integration/UI/Query_params).

## Embedded form (iFrame)

You can embed the Layerswap widget directly in your app and customize it to fit your specific use case.

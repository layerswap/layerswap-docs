You do not need to import anything extra to make use of event callbacks, instead simply add them using the events field inside the settings prop on [LayerswapProvider](/react-sdk/providers/dynamiccontextprovider).

```jsx  theme={"system"}
<LayerswapProvider
    callbacks={{
      // events callbacks go here
    }}
>
  ...
</LayerswapProvider>
```


[**onFormChange**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onFormChange): Called whenever the swap form values change — for example, when the user updates the asset, amount, or destination network.

[**onSwapCreate**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onSwapCreate): Called when a new swap is successfully created after submitting the form.

[**onSwapComplete**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onSwapComplete): Called when a swap completes successfully on-chain or via an integrated exchange.

[**onSwapIdChange**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onSwapIdChange): Called whenever the active swap ID changes — for example, when a new swap is created or the current swap resets.

[**onSwapModalStateChange**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onSwapModalStateChange): Called when the swap modal is opened or closed.

[**onBackClick**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onBackClick): Called when the user clicks the back button in the swap flow.

[**onError**](/integration/UI/Widget/EventCallbacks/onError): Called whenever an unexpected error occurs during the swap flow — such as network or API issues.

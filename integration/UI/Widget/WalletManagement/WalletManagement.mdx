The widget has a built-in wallet management UI, so you can connect the wallet and use the widget as a standalone dApp out of the box. However, when embedding the widget into the dApp, reusing the existing wallet management UI of that dApp makes the most sense.

There are several ecosystems and types of chains (EVM, SVM, UTXO) supported by the widget, and therefore, there are several different libraries used to manage wallet connections to these chains.

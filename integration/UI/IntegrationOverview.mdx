## Overview

The Layerswap UI integration is the fastest way to let your users bridge, swap, and deposit crypto from 90+ sources directly inside your app without building custom infrastructure.

Choose between two simple options — a React Widget or an embeddable iFrame — to enable your users to seamlessly bridge assets across blockchains or deposit directly from centralized exchanges into on-chain wallets. The interface is fully customizable, allowing you to tailor the look and feel to match your app’s design and environment.

### Key Highlights

The UI Integration provides:

- Pre-built UI components for bridging and swapping across all the Layerswap supported chains.
- Seperate flows for deposits from CEXes and swaps across chains, and ability to hide one or the other.
- Modular wallet management that can be extended or replaced depending on your integration needs.
- Ability to set defaults: tabs, source chain, destination chain, tokens, destination address.
- Ability to filter or restrict certain chains, tokens, exchanges, if needed.
- Customization options for matching the theme to your brand (colors, border radius, typography).
- Customization playground to adjust the UI and test the updates before going live.
- Theme examples for extra fast integration (dark, light, minimalistic, branded).

### Ideal For

- dApps, NFT marketplaces, wallets, gaming and DeFi platforms that want a fast solution for enabling cross-chain swaps.
- Projects looking to accept deposits from any ecosystem without building bridging logic.
- Platform interested in onboarding users from Centralized Exchanges in an easy way.

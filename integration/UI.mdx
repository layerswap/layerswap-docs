## Layerswap-hosted page

You can redirect users from your Web or Mobile app to Layerswap and customize their journey by providing [query parameters](/integration/UI-customization).

## React Widget

Layerswap provides native React component, which allows rendering Layerswap widget directly inside your app. Widget supports, network/token selection, swap creation and completion.
You will be able to inject your wallet into the widget.

To get started:

```bash
npm i @layerswap/widget
```

## Embedded form

You can embed the Layerswap widget directly in your app and customize it to fit your specific use case.

```javascript
<iframe src="https://layerswap.io/app/?
    clientId=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    &to=STARKNET_MAINNET
    &from=ETHEREUM_MAINNET
    &destAddress=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    &amount=27
    &asset=IMX
    &actionButtonText=Deposit">
</iframe>
```



## Customization 
You can pass various parameters to modify the look and UX of the Layerswap Hosted App. Example:

```javascript
https://layerswap.io/app/?
    clientId=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    &to=STARKNET_MAINNET

    &destAddress=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Layerswap provides two ways of completing the swap. 

1) Wallet transfers are transfers done from a wallet, with calldata to the Solver's address. This case is used when the direct wallet connection is available to the user's wallet and the dApp can compose a transaction and send it to the wallet for signing and execution.

2) The manual flow is a unique feature of Layerswap. Layerswap generates a unique address for each swap. Whenever any transaction is sent to this wallet, the swap will be completed. This case is really useful when there is no direct connection to the user's wallet and you can just show the address to the user and ask them to send the funds.

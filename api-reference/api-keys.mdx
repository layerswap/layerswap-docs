For integrating Layerswap, partners should register in the Dashboard and set up an organization.

Each partner account can create an organization and app(s) within that organization. The organization serves as a logical grouping for multiple associated apps. The app stores all the partner-related information like API keys for programmatic access, webhooks, and other configurations that are needed for the integration and customizations.

### Register as a Partner

1. Go to https://layerswap.io/dashboard and register
2. Create an organization & app under the organization
3. Go to the newly created app and copy the API key

<Tip>Client Id is used for embedded form or Layerswap-hosted page.</Tip>
<Warning>API Key is used for accessing API and should be stored privately. </Warning>
